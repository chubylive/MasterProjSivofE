Khoa ‚Äî 02/20/2022
i'd like to quick meeting now to describe to you how the build process will work for you. and then i'd like you to try it out yourself, and then let me know if it works for you, or if you run into any issues that i need to fix
Stew ‚Äî 02/20/2022
sure i'm here
Khoa ‚Äî 02/20/2022
i am not done with my C code for the program yet. for that, I'd like a quick meeting tomorrow (I will be done with the C code tomorrow) when we can talk about the C program. but let's get the build process out of the way now.
chubylive ‚Äî 02/20/2022
looks good. got a bin file
Khoa ‚Äî 02/20/2022
Super
Stew ‚Äî 02/20/2022
yeah got a bin as well! never doubted you man
Khoa ‚Äî 02/20/2022
We are ready to roll. Yay.
Khoa ‚Äî 02/21/2022
please don't wait for me if you have other things to do. i am still debugging. i'll give out an update later tonight when i am done. i will post what i currently have later tonight as well.
i will post in git
Stew ‚Äî 02/21/2022
üëç
chubylive ‚Äî 02/21/2022
if you want another pair of eyes i am available
Khoa ‚Äî 02/21/2022
Thanks Chuby! I'll let you know.
Khoa ‚Äî 02/22/2022
i just checked in our first working program. it is in sw @ sw/0.c . sorry for the delay! it works. let's have a quick meeting tomorrow. that program that i just checked in finds all prime numbers using all available bram, which is currently 256 pe multiply 16kilobits for each pe, meaning it finds all primes up to 256 * 16 * 1024 - 1 = 4194303. it means it finds correctly all primes that are less than or equal 4194303
it runs pretty quickly
there are things remaining that i still need to do of course, and i found a number of optimizations that can be done to make it run even faster, and we can put in clock counter to measure performance.
and we can use up all bram to have 280 pe's, and there are other things that can be done as well.
Khoa ‚Äî 02/22/2022
guys, let's have a quick meeting!

Khoa you da man! I can add timing code blocks
pretty epic actually
Khoa ‚Äî 02/22/2022
yay

less than a second to execute the compute command
the read takes longer. I took out the print statement to get a better time
Stew ‚Äî 02/25/2022
nice
haven't gotten a chance to work on my part yet, will start this weekend
chubylive ‚Äî 02/28/2022
I wrote a kernel module for the code
you can try loading it with ismod
I am getting 75msec compute time
so a little faster but the printk is really slow so printing the primes takes a long time
a really long time

man theres a lot of prime numbers
I almost feel like we could do interrupts but meh
Khoa ‚Äî 02/28/2022
wow. so going to the kernel does make the code to run faster.
by the way, guys if you have question please let me know.
just some update from me: i still need to check in git, but i currently have a new build (and verify using C code that it is working) where we can maximize bram usage all the way to 100% and max out the number of pe at 280. this working build also includes already a number of other optimizations in the hardware design. but recently, after getting the 280-pe build to work, i discovered yet more hardware optimizations that i can do. however, for the second group of hardware optimization features that i recently discover, i will have to do them later since right now i am concentrating on the remaining computing methods.
so far we completed the computing method #1
one thing i forget to let you know (i will need to explain more details in our next meeting) that the computing method #2 can use the same exact build as computing method #1, but only the software is different. and computing method #2 allows the computing to twice the maximum limit compared to method #1 and therefore about twice the number of primes  being discovered compared to #1. again, only the software is different. the hardware can stay the same with absolutely no performance penalty. and i already got a working C program for computing method #2.
so with that we are done with the first two methods #1 and #2
currently i am working on the hardware for computing method #3. again as i mentioned before, everything can stay the same including about more than half of the PE rtl design. some of the internal design of the pe will have to change for computing methods #3 and #4 and i am doing that.
so time continues to be tight, and we all need to continue to push hard.
but do not panic since i think we will get it all done guys.
and we need also the final presentation and the report.
Stew ‚Äî 03/01/2022
I have already started w/ the report
also checked in some changes to make the row/#pe modifiable i also  put everything into a class ... using cpp for the driver code, can change if we don't want it that way i guess
i want to get some timing diagrams
this is what i'm seeing so far
Image
does that make sense?
also i didn't see a progress update 4 in canvas...
Khoa ‚Äî 03/01/2022
the prof did not hand out assignment 4 i guess
let's just have a quick meeting either today or tomorrow just to catch up on things, then we can run off to our little corners and keep pushing forward
Stew ‚Äî 03/01/2022
ok i'll be free tomorrow
Khoa ‚Äî 03/01/2022
ok let's make it tomorrow. a quick one just to tag up.
Stew ‚Äî 03/02/2022
do we still plan on meeting today?
Khoa ‚Äî 03/02/2022
yes can we meet quickly @ 5:30 CA time, which is 7:30 TX time, and 8:30 DC time? just a quick one.
Stew ‚Äî 03/02/2022
ok
chubylive ‚Äî 03/03/2022
yeah I will be available
chubylive ‚Äî 03/03/2022
we meeting?
Stew ‚Äî 03/03/2022
we met yesterday @chubylive
chubylive ‚Äî 03/03/2022
oh dang I thought it was today
I was out kold yesterday
Stew ‚Äî 03/03/2022
np it's just pretty much what khoa typed in chat
chubylive ‚Äî 03/03/2022
what did I miss
Stew ‚Äî 03/03/2022
going to have the fully utilized bram by this weekend and he's also working the #2 and #3 algorithm compute
chubylive ‚Äî 03/03/2022
kay. We need to put stuff together for the presentation
Stew ‚Äî 03/03/2022
yea
chubylive ‚Äî 03/03/2022
did he give us a guide?
Stew ‚Äî 03/03/2022
don't think so
chubylive ‚Äî 03/03/2022
hm. I guess we just start a power point
do we have a software implementation of the seive?
something like this should work a comparison against a single pe https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sieve-of-eratosthenes/
GeeksforGeeks
Sieve of Eratosthenes - GeeksforGeeks
Sieve of Eratosthenes - The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the efficient ways to find all primes smaller than given n

Stew ‚Äî 03/03/2022
i have an implementation in python
but yeah having a baseline would be a good idea
chubylive ‚Äî 03/03/2022
okay. either way we need to show the complexity of the algorithm
Stew ‚Äî 03/03/2022
hmm but idk if petalinux can run python
chubylive ‚Äî 03/03/2022
the one I shared was a O(N log(log N))
it can be added to the rootfs but is worth the trouble

o(n)
Stew ‚Äî 03/03/2022
ah
chubylive ‚Äî 03/03/2022
and is similar to our approach
chubylive ‚Äî 03/06/2022
eh. Thinking about it again I dont think we will get much info from running an algorithmic comparison. We can you python code and time it to see how much of an improvement we get
Khoa ‚Äî 03/07/2022
Let‚Äôs have a quick meeting tomorrow!
chubylive ‚Äî 03/08/2022
what time are you thinking 8:30 9?
Khoa ‚Äî 03/08/2022
my schedule is open. please select the time that works best for you.
chubylive ‚Äî 03/08/2022
kay i might have some engagment 6-8 so 8:30 9 is looking good for me but that might change so I will keep you posted .
Khoa ‚Äî 03/08/2022
ok
Khoa ‚Äî 03/08/2022
if Chuby is not available, let's meet tomorrow after class
Stew ‚Äî 03/08/2022
ok did chuby mean 8:30 his time?
Khoa ‚Äî 03/08/2022
it is 6:30 here, so it is 9:30 for Chuby
btw, i just for method 3 working
just got
Stew ‚Äî 03/08/2022
oh ok right
yeah i'm ok to meet after class tomorrow
Khoa ‚Äî 03/08/2022
and method 4 is close behind.
i pulled my hair out just now for about two hours, got too many programs lying around. got to organize a bit here üôÇ
ok let's meet tomorrow.
chubylive ‚Äî 03/08/2022
Sorry guys
we have class tomorrow?
see the notification
Khoa ‚Äî 03/08/2022
yes Prof requested that everyone present for class tomorrow Wed from 4-6pm
Khoa ‚Äî 03/09/2022
i made a bunch of push to git. please pull all!
Khoa ‚Äî 03/09/2022
yay one more week yay üôÇ
Khoa ‚Äî 03/09/2022
how do you guys want to vote on this?
chubylive ‚Äî 03/09/2022
more time is welcome as long as does not add more complexity
Khoa ‚Äî 03/09/2022
no we are done with scope. our scope has not changed for weeks now.
chubylive ‚Äî 03/09/2022
then yeah more time to generate doc and presentation material is welcome
Khoa ‚Äî 03/09/2022
i think so too. how do you think Stew?
we will have a quick meeting right after class is done
chubylive ‚Äî 03/09/2022
yeah
chubylive ‚Äî 03/10/2022
Sorry guys. My sleep schedule has been messed up. I fell asleep towards the end of the class meeting
did you end up meeting after the class
stew can you give me the lowdown
I should be available after work today 6-7pm est
Stew ‚Äî 03/10/2022
sure thing @chubylive
i feel you on sleep schedule man
chubylive ‚Äî 03/10/2022
you available?
Stew ‚Äî 03/10/2022
yea sorry free now chuby
Khoa ‚Äî 03/14/2022
i am going to push to git, which includes the final version of files for bitstream build for both methods 1 and 2, and method 3. the final version has clock counter which can be used for performance measurement. i was able to fit in all 280 pe's for the final version for both methods 1 and 2, and method 3.
Khoa ‚Äî 03/15/2022
i just pushed to git for final RTL of methods 1, 2, and 3. i also updated C files for corresponding reference drivers and models/expected output text file (updated model/expected output text file for method 3 only, due to now i am able to fit all 280 PE in for method 3 RTL).
chubylive ‚Äî 03/15/2022
these are changes to both the C code and vivado project
Khoa ‚Äî 03/15/2022
yeah
the final RTL all have clock counters. and in the updated drivers (the C files), there are references on how to use the clock counter.
chubylive ‚Äî 03/15/2022
yeah I was gonna try running to get number for the presentation
takes quite  a while to build
I guess we are going to abandon comp 4 and focus on the presentation?
Khoa ‚Äî 03/15/2022
i already stopped playing further with the methods 1, 2, and 3 RTL üôÇ so those RTL are final unless we have a need to go back and modify them
oh the method 4 is about done as well.
chubylive ‚Äî 03/15/2022
kk
Khoa ‚Äî 03/15/2022
yeah i will also work on the presentation and the report
i think i should let you guys look at what i just checked in and then we can have a quick meeting right after class tomorrow, or on Thursday.
chubylive ‚Äî 03/15/2022
kk
Khoa ‚Äî 03/15/2022
yeah i know i got carried away, i got too much fun with the RTL development man üôÇ but i know it's time to stop üôÇ
chubylive ‚Äî 03/15/2022
lol. I feel you. find you grove and you just fall in. I think we have a lot to condense in to the slides
gotta make pretty charts and diagrams to channel all you effort to the class
I mean professor lol
Khoa ‚Äî 03/15/2022
yeah i know.
Stew ‚Äî 03/15/2022
i'm free tomorrow or thursday to meet 
Khoa ‚Äî 03/16/2022
do we want to have a quick meeting now? or tomorrow?
chubylive ‚Äî 03/16/2022
i am awake lol
so today works
Khoa ‚Äî 03/16/2022
ok. let's have it right after this.

@Khoa  seeing some weird results with Computation method 1 & 2, it might just be sw related, could you help us take a look?
this is running driver.cpp
Khoa ‚Äî 03/18/2022
yes. what is the weird results that you are seeing?
from the screenshot, it looks like it is the driver for method 1, not yet method 2
Stew ‚Äî 03/18/2022
it's missing prime results no?
where's 5, 7 
Khoa ‚Äî 03/18/2022
then that is a problem
can you send me the code? or is it the same as what is already checked in?
Stew ‚Äî 03/18/2022
yeah it's already checked in
Khoa ‚Äî 03/18/2022
ok

MasterProjSivofE\Computational_Methods_1_and_2\sw\Computational_Method_1\driver\driver.cpp
Khoa ‚Äî 03/18/2022
when was the bitstream built? i mean did you pull the latest, both hw and sw, and build and test using the latest?
Stew ‚Äî 03/18/2022
@chubylive  can u answer?
chubylive ‚Äî 03/18/2022
it was built last night
one se
c
the 15th
Khoa ‚Äî 03/18/2022
can you retrieve the git commit number, or commit id, for that build? i just want to make sure you did build with the latest?
chubylive ‚Äî 03/18/2022
be54a27b9dffa952dfb2b7d9fd877d57d8ab15d6
Khoa ‚Äî 03/18/2022
ok so it is the latest for method 1 and 2
and you use the same corresponding driver.c i suppose?
i also included the expected output (in the case all rows of all pe's are used) in all the 'model' directory
one thing we can do to save time further: the bit stream is only a few megabytes each. i don't mind doing all the builds because i did that all the time. should i start posting bin files so that should save you time? i think i should do that.
yeah build is automated but build time is still long. ok. i am trying this right now: please expect bin files in your mailbox soon. only one bin per email. the title of the email i should mention what the attached bin file is for.
chubylive ‚Äî 03/18/2022
yeah using the driver.c in the appropriate folder
Khoa ‚Äî 03/18/2022
please use the bin file that i just sent to see if you see better result
ok sorry. we should do everything to save time. from now on, i should provide the bin files. you can build if you prefer, and i will always check in everything in git. but if you want to save time and not have to wait for the build to complete, you can just use the bin files i provide.
chubylive ‚Äî 03/18/2022
it just hangs
for but software comp 1 and 2
Khoa ‚Äî 03/18/2022
you meant i just hang for the model.c
?
you meant it just hang for the model.c?
if it is not too troublesome, try restart the board. now that you have the bin files, please make sure you pull the latest and use only the latest sw. with the bin files, you can start testing right away and not have to do any build.
the fact that it hangs i think means the sw and hw are not compatible. so something is out of sync here. we just have to make sure everything is latest, to make sure the hw and sw are in sync.
if you can share screen i can get involved with the debugging too
chubylive ‚Äî 03/18/2022
sure
wanna hope on the call
